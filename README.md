# NutrientExplorer User Guide

User Guide for Nutrient Explorer R Shiny App

Purpose: An analytical framework (downloadable R Shiny application) to visualize and investigate drivers of surface water quality.

Features

     - This application provides the user with the ability to analyze lake total nitrogen or total phosphorus data for Northeastern U.S. lakes based on LAGOS NE data (https://lagoslakes.org/lagos-ne/).
     - Alternatively, the user can upload their own dataset after properly formatting the data. 
     - The user can summarize and visualize temporal and spatial patterns using a variety of approaches.
     - Subsets of the dataset can be created for further analysis using various characteristics of the variables, such as date, location, etc. 
     - Finally, the user can apply either random forest modeling or multiple linear regression to assess which predictor variables best model the spatial patterns in the water quality dataset and the models can be used to predict water quality concentrations for watersheds or locations lacking data.

       b. Subset the data by selecting specific Program Names, Program Types or HUC2 zones.
       c. Click “Save my subset.”
       
     4. “Explore Subset” Tab:
     
       a. Follow the same steps as step 2 above. 
       
     5. “Run Models” Tab: 
     
       a. Select the “Random Forest” model option first and click “Choose this Model”
         i. Select the endpoint for the model run (LogTP was used for this paper). 
         ii. Mouse over the different Model parameter options such as “ntree” to learn about each. 
         iii. Select predictor variables for the model (center section of the app).
            1. Practice using the different ways of selecting variables, such as by clicking “Select all default variables.” Or by clicking “Select all in Group*”, or by clicking in the blank box for each variable group and choosing a variable from the dropdown. 
            2. Practice removing variables by either clicking on the “X” on the right-hand side of the variable name or by clicking on the variable to highlight it in blue and then pressing the backspace or delete button on your keyboard.  
            3. Notice the pop-up information when mousing over a variable to get more detailed information about the variable. 
            4. Once all variables are chosen, click “Run random forest” button on the bottom left. 
            5. Scroll down to see the initial results and figures that appear for the model
            6. Click on the “See additional plots and maps” button on the bottom right

               a. Scroll down and click on “only show cells with high correlation”
                  i. Based on the correlated variables (those displayed in red, with black background), manually choose one of the correlated variables and delete it from the above predictor variable selection area. 
               b. Click “Run Correlation Analysis” and repeat above until no correlated variables remain. 
         iv. Step 2 Run Subset Selection

Instructions for formatting new dataset:

     1. Download example data file from the Load Data Tab  
     2. Make sure that your dataset has at least one of the response variables with the exact same naming format: “TN”, “TP”, “LogTN” or “LogTP”
     3. Make sure the predictor variables and other explanatory variables like latitude and longitude, HUC2, HUC8 are present.
